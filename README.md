# A humble implementation of Dartmouth Basic

This is an attempt to implement a 60s implementation of BASIC as an interpreter.I am implementing it in Ruby. 

So far I have an object that does most of the interpreting. I am working on the object that will run it. At this point it can run most PRINT statements and some basic LET statements.

This is my exploration on how to create an interpreter. Most of the time I load too much on theory before jumping into code; this time I am doing the opposite. I haven't read anything about how to write an interpreter beyond the classic definition that it is a program and execute things one line at a time.
