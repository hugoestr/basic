# A humble implementation of Dartmouth Basic

This is an attempt to implement a 60s implementation of BASIC as an interpreter.I am implementing it in BASIC. 

So far I have an object that does most of the interpreting. I am working on the object that will run it.

This is my exploration on how to create an interpreter. Most of the time I load too much on theory before jumping into code; this time I am doing the opposite. I haven't read anything about how to write an interpreter beyond the classic definition that it is a program and execute things one line at a time.
